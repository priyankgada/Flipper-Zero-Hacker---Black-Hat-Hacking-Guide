 # Bharatiya Shesha University

With more than 400+ Reviews and 4/5 Average Ratings! Here's everything about our company and instructors :

We are a group of people who strongly believe that the traditional education system tests a fish with its ability to climb a tree and tests a monkey with its ability to swim. Students should explore and learn whatever they like and will only be happy in their respected field.

Founder 'Priyank Gada' was an ethical hacker, who moved on to Digital Forensics Investigation as an investigator later turned into a malware analyst and a YouTuber. Here's what he has concluded - "All my courses were free for 2 years from 2015 to 2018. People don't value the efforts of the instructor. It takes tons of hours to develop and upload each course but people just give bad reviews. I know that not all courses are good and everyone needs to learn new things but the type of feedback hurts a lot. Paid courses get good reviews because people actually understand the value of money and watch the course till the end while free courses are not even seen. Thus it was hard time to go commercial!'.

With this intention, our team started working even harder to develop quality content with the feedback and bad reviews to keep on improving the content and today we have more than 400 reviews with 4/5 average ratings.
